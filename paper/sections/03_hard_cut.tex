\section{Hard Cut Detection}
\label{sec:hard_cut}

For our hard cut detection implementation, we chose a standard machine learning approach.
We extract features from the frames and use them to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
The following section explains steps we took for that, presents the problems we encountered, and evaluates our final results.
