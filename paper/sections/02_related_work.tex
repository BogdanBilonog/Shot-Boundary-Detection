\subsection{Shot Boundary Detection}

\subsection{Hard Cut Detection}

\subsection{Deep Neural Networks}
Deep neural networks were very successful in image classification and video classifaction tasks in the last years.

Learning has seen a recent rise in popularity in the computer vision community.

On the contrary, research in shot boundary detection has ceased in the last years.
From 2001 until 2007, the TRECVid~\cite{trecvid} conference series was hosting .
The TRECVID committee provided videos with manually annotated gold data, which could be used by different research groups to develop and test their algorithms.
However, as told before, the last challenge for shot boundary detection was in 2007.
We think this decline in research is largely because the current approaches are highly developed, and there is no much potential for further improvements.

This is why we propose to use deep learning approaches for shot boundary detection.
The next sections will detail our approach.
