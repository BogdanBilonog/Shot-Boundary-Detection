\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

What went wrong:
More data?

In summary.
We still think, that the soft cut detection could be solved with deep learning.
However, the basic approach with using a recurrent neural network does not work.
More work and innovation is required in this area.

We think that the main problem is, that the convolutional network cannot really learn good features, because there is nothing characteristic about a soft cut frame.
