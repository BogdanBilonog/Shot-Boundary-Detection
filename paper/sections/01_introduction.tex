Shot boundary detection is an important preprocessing step.
It is the first step to approaching problems such as 


Humans can detect hard cuts and soft cuts by also taking the context into account.
By understanding the scenes, they are able to distinguish between a real cut and a moving object.
For the computer, this distinction is hard to made.

In this paper, we present a new approach to hard and soft cut detection using deep neural networks.
Deep neural networks have seen a rise in popularity in the computer vision community in the last years.
This rise is mostly due to impressive improvements in image classification and video classification tasks.
Shot boundary detection can be
